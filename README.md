# Banking System in Python

## Introduction
This is a simple banking system implemented in Python that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view their transaction history. The system automatically generates account numbers and provides a user-friendly command-line interface for interaction.

## Features
- **Create Account**: Users can create a new account with a unique account number.
- **Credit Money**: Users can deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Users can withdraw money from their account, with a check for sufficient balance.
- **Check Balance**: Users can view their current account balance.
- **Display Transactions**: Users can view a history of all transactions made on their account.
- **Display All Accounts**: The system can display all accounts with their details.

When withdrawing money, the system now displays the current balance before processing the withdrawal.
